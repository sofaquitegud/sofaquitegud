### 🔥 Projects I'm Proud Of

#### 🇲🇾 [Malaysia Economic Data Pipeline](https://github.com/sofaquitegud/economic-data-pipeline)
End-to-end Medallion Architecture pipeline that pulls Malaysia's economic data from data.gov.my and turns it into pretty dashboards. Bronze → Silver → Gold, you know the drill.

#### 📈 [Pulse-Stream](https://github.com/sofaquitegud/pulse-stream)
Real-time crypto tracking with Kafka + Spark. Built it to catch market movements before my coffee gets cold ☕

#### 🏈 [NFL Big Data Bowl 2026](https://github.com/sofaquitegud/NFL_Big_Data_Bowl_2026)
Crunched 560K+ player tracking records. Turns out sports analytics is basically geometry with extra steps.

#### 📊 [Sales & Use Tax Automation](https://github.com/sofaquitegud/sales-use-tax-analytics)
